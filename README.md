Case Studies of Cryptocurrency (Monero), DeFi(THORChain), and NFT (BAYC). Analyzing strategy : W5H1, 4T Methods, and the 6-Metrics Method

The 4T Method and W5H1 Method can be combined together to provide a more comprehensive analysis of a project.

//Monero
Applying both methods to Monero:

Who: Monero is developed and maintained by a group of anonymous individuals and organizations.
What: Monero is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that uses advanced cryptography to obscure transaction data and enhance user privacy.
Where: Monero can be used and traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges and platforms worldwide.
When: Monero was first launched in April 2014.
Why: Monero was created to address privacy concerns in the cryptocurrency space, specifically in response to the lack of privacy in Bitcoin transactions.
How: Monero uses a technique called "ring signatures" to conceal the origin of a transaction, making it difficult to trace the sender or receiver of funds.
Timeline: Monero has been around since 2014, which gives it a relatively long history and track record. This could be seen as a strength in terms of its longevity and established reputation. However, it could also be seen as a weakness in terms of its slow adoption and development compared to newer projects.
Tokenomic: Monero's tokenomic model is based on a proof-of-work consensus mechanism, which gives it a relatively decentralized and secure network. However, the energy consumption associated with proof-of-work can be seen as a weakness from an environmental standpoint.
Team: Monero's team is anonymous, which could be seen as a strength in terms of privacy and security, but it could also be seen as a weakness in terms of accountability and trust.
Technology: Monero's technology, specifically its use of ring signatures and stealth addresses, provides a high degree of privacy and security. However, this technology may not be as well-established or battle-tested as other projects.

//THORChain
Who: THORChain is developed and maintained by a group of anonymous individuals and organizations.
What: THORChain is a decentralized exchange and liquidity protocol that allows users to trade and swap different cryptocurrencies in a trustless, permissionless manner.
Where: THORChain can be accessed and used on various platforms and wallets that support the Binance Smart Chain.
When: THORChain was launched in 2020.
Why: THORChain was created to address the issues of centralized exchanges, such as lack of control over funds and security vulnerabilities, and to provide a more decentralized and trustless way of trading and swapping cryptocurrencies.
How: THORChain uses a technique called "automated market making" (AMM) to provide liquidity and match orders in a decentralized manner.
Timeline: THORChain is a relatively new project, which could be seen as a weakness in terms of its lack of history and track record. However, it could also be seen as a strength in terms of its potential for growth and innovation.
Tokenomic: THORChain's tokenomic model is based on a liquidity provision mechanism. The tokenomic model can be seen as a strength as it incentivizes users to provide liquidity to the network and could make it more sustainable over time.
Team: The team behind THORChain is anonymous, which could be seen as a strength in terms of privacy and security, but it could also be seen as a weakness in terms of accountability and trust.
Technology: THORChain's technology is based on the Binance Smart Chain and uses Automated market making (AMM) to provide liquidity. This technology is relatively new and untested, which could be seen as a weakness in terms of its potential for bugs and vulnerabilities.

//BAYC: Combing all three methods in BAYC
Who: BAYC is developed and maintained by a group of anonymous individuals and organizations.
What: BAYC is a platform that allows users to mint, buy, sell, and trade unique, one-of-a-kind digital assets called non-fungible tokens (NFTs).
Where: BAYC can be accessed and used on various platforms and marketplaces that support the Ethereum blockchain.
When: BAYC was launched in 2020
Why: BAYC was created to provide a platform for the creation and trade of unique digital assets that can be verified and authenticated on the blockchain, allowing for true ownership and control of these assets.
How: BAYC uses the Ethereum blockchain to mint and verify the authenticity of NFTs, and smart contracts to facilitate the buying and selling of these assets.
Timeline: BAYC is a relatively new project, which could be seen as a weakness in terms of its lack of history and track record. However, it could also be seen as a strength in terms of its potential for growth and innovation.
Tokenomic: BAYC's tokenomic model is based on the creation and sale of NFTs, which could be seen as a strength in terms of its potential for monetization and revenue generation. However, it also could be seen as a weakness if the market for NFTs decreases in the future.
Team: The team behind BAYC is anonymous, which could be seen as a strength in terms of privacy and security, but it could also be seen as a weakness in terms of accountability and trust.
Technology: BAYC's technology is based on the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts, which provides a high degree of transparency and verifiability for NFTs.

The 6-Metrics method is a method of evaluating NFT projects by analyzing six specific metrics.

Applying this method to BAYC:

Floor Price: The floor price of an NFT refers to the lowest price at which it can be sold. For BAYC, the floor price could be determined by the minimum amount required to mint a new NFT on the platform.
Number of Unique Holders: The number of unique holders refers to the number of distinct individuals or entities that own a particular NFT. For BAYC, this number can be determined by analyzing the blockchain data and counting the number of unique addresses that hold a BAYC NFT.
Market Cap: The market cap of an NFT project refers to the total value of all NFTs in circulation. For BAYC, this can be calculated by multiplying the total supply of NFTs by the current average price of an NFT.
Volume Traded: The volume traded refers to the total value of NFTs that have been bought and sold within a specific period of time. For BAYC, this can be determined by analyzing the blockchain data and calculating the total value of NFTs that have been traded on the platform.
Rarity Score: The rarity score of an NFT refers to its uniqueness and scarcity. For BAYC, the rarity score can be determined by analyzing the total supply of NFTs, the number of unique holders, and the number of minted NFTs.
Diamond Hand Balance: Diamond hand balance refers to the NFT holders who never sell their assets, no matter how low the price goes. It's an indicator of community engagement and faith in the project. This can be determined by analyzing the blockchain data and identifying NFT holders who have held their assets for an extended period of time without selling.
By analyzing these six metrics, one can get a better understanding of the overall health and potential of the BAYC project. However, it's important to note that these metrics alone do not provide a complete picture, and should be considered in conjunction with other factors such as the project's overall vision, the team behind it, the technology used, and the current market conditions.
